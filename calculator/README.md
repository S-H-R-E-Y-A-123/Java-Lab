This project is a menu-driven Java application that performs various mathematical operations and array manipulations. The program demonstrates key programming concepts like object-oriented programming (OOP), control flow structures, and basic array operations. It allows users to interact through a menu to perform operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, Fibonacci series generation, and calculations involving arrays (sum, mean, and mode).

The program is organized into three classes:

Input: Handles user input for numbers and arrays.
Calculator: Contains methods for arithmetic and array operations, such as sumOfArray, meanOfArray, modeOfArray, and fibonacci. The mode function uses a nested loop to determine the most frequently occurring value in an array.
Main1: The entry point of the program, which implements a menu using a while loop and a switch-case structure to call appropriate methods based on user choice.
How It Works
Users are prompted to select an operation from a menu. For example, choosing "Fibonacci series" allows the user to input the number of terms to generate.
Arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction accept two numbers as input, while array-based operations allow users to input the size and elements of an array.
